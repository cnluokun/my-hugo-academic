I am a Master student in the [State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems](http://www.compsys.ia.ac.cn/EN/index.html) in the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academic of Sciences(CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/).Prior to studying in CASIA,I received my BEng degree from School of Automation in Beijing Institute of Technology,[an elite university](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/china) in China in 2016.During my undergraduate period,I was selected to join the Outstanding Undergraduates International Exchange Program sponsored by the [Chinese Scholarship Council(CSC)](https://www.csc.edu.cn/) and studied in [the Department of Electrical Engineering](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy) in Linköping University,Sweden for one academic year.In Sep.2016,I was enrolled in [the Graduate School of Information,Production and Systems](https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/en/) of Waseda University in Japan with fund awards.

My research interests includes **robotics visual perception**, motion plan and controlling with a focus on redundant armed robots.My major research lies on **trajectory planning** and **motion control** of a 7-DoF manipulator, involving with force and position compositioned **compliant control** such as variable and adaptive **Impedance/Admittance control** for manipulator's contact-rich tasks.
